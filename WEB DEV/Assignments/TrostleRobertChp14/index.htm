<span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; color:#000">The Rough Start of Pittsburgh Mills</span>

<p>Pittsburgh Mills was developed by the Mills Corporation as a shopping mall featuring full-price retailers and department stores Macy’s, JCPenney, Sears and Dick’s Sporting Goods and an adjacent big box shopping district featuring such names as Wal-Mart, Sam’s Club, Lowe’s and Ross Dress for Less. It would be the first departure for the Mills, which had developed outlet centers in other parts of the country. The mall was built on what was previously open farmland. It is located in Frazer Township, just outside of Tarentum off of U.S. Route 28. The Pennsylvania Turnpike is located a few miles south.</p>

<img src="index_files/images/Steelers.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197", style="float: right; padding:0px 15px" />

<p>When it first opened in July 2005, the mall section, called the Galleria at Pittsburgh Mills, featured over 150 shops, restaurants and a large food court. Tenants such as American Eagle Outfitters to Pac Sun, Aeropostale to Forever 21 and so on were among some of the retailers. These shops would be located within distinctive “neighborhoods” that pays homage to the Pittsburgh region. It would also differ from other malls in the area in that it offered numerous entertainment offerings for every age and taste. Attractions included Lucky Strike Lanes, an upscale bowling alley, the Putting Edge glow-in-the-dark mini golf, a Tilt arcade and the Cinemark megaplex cinema featuring an IMAX theater. A proposed NASCAR Speedpark also planned to open at the mall, although it was scrapped prior to the mall’s grand opening, despite “Coming Soon” signs posted for months after the mall’s opening.</p>

<p>Even though the big box section, called the Village at Pittsburgh Mills, was instantaneously successful, the Galleria portion would start facing a series of problems, first of all with its owner, the Mills Corporation. Mills faced a series of financial problems prior to the development of Pittsburgh Mills, and in addition to management misconduct within the company, it was acquired by Simon Property Group in 2007, where as Pittsburgh Mills was sold to Zamias Services, a mall developer and minority owner based in nearby Johnstown. The second problem was within the mall itself. Although the Galleria at Pittsburgh Mills is a relatively new mall, it also faced numerous vacancies, some which had never been filled since the mall first opened. By August 2006, Lucky Strike Lanes announced that it would close due to dwindling traffic. It would be divided into two restaurants shortly thereafter, although one of the restaurants have closed recently and the other one has been downgraded into a bar. Linens ’n Things, another mall anchor, also closed in the summer of 2008 as part of a restructuring. Some tenants have closed as well, including G by Guess, Forever 21, Brooks Brothers 346, Corningware Factory Store, Music For A Song, among other tenants. The mall’s occupancy rate currently stands at 75 to 80 percent.</p>

<img src="index_files/images/llbean.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197", style="float: left; padding:0px 15px" />

<p>Zamias currently has a few ideas that it plans to put into action at the Galleria. One of these plans is to convert a large portion of inline retail space into an ITT Technical Institute, which is expected to relocate from nearby Monroeville. Other ideas that have been announced in the past include an indoor water park in the SportStreet neighborhood and a department store anchor such as Boscov’s to be built in the space that was supposed to be occupied by NASCAR Speedpark.</p>

<p>Although the typical Landmark Mills mall is synonymous with outlet shopping, Pittsburgh Mills is the only center to offer an entire lineup of full-price retailers that otherwise could be found in a traditional enclosed mall. The reason for this goes back to 1981, when developer Zamias Services, Inc. of Johnstown, planned to develop a regional mall on the Frazer Township site. Legal setbacks and financial difficulties had postponed the project for many years, until the Mills Corporation announced in 1986 that they would partner in conjunction with Zamias to build a retail and entertainment complex on the site.</p>

<p>In mid April 2015 the mall constructed a Sky Trail that now occupies a corner of the food court, in hopes of drumming up entertainment and business. The corner was previously vacant as a staging area for small pageants and school band concerts. Sky Trail was closed and removed in fall of 2017.</p>

<p>As part of a foreclosure sale, the mall was auctioned off for $100 in January 2017.</p>

<span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; color:#000">Uncertain Future Worries Shoppers</span>

<p>It’s been nearly a year since a new owner bought the Pittsburgh Mills mall in Frazer, touting plans to redevelop the struggling, 14-year-old facility.</p>

<p>Despite the owner’s hopeful nature in May 2019, township officials say they still haven’t met or had any communication with Long Island-based Mason Asset Management and are disappointed with the progress made over the past year. “They’re not hands-on here except for their staff,” said Lori Ziencik, supervisor and township secretary. “It seems they’re disinterested in the property.” Multiple messages left for Elliot Nassim, president of Mason Asset Management, were not returned. Mall management wasn’t able to comment unless approved by Nassim.</p>

<img src="index_files/images/closed.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197", style="float: right; padding:0px 15px" />

<p>Four new tenants have moved into the mall over the past year: Himalayan Salts Co., Focus on the Arts, Chicken Connection and Allegheny Health Network’s Citizens School of Nursing. The owner of Chicken Connection declined to comment, and a message left for Himalayan Salts Co. wasn’t returned. AHN has said the mall is a good fit for the nursing school because of its location off Route 28 and the large space left empty by ITT Tech was already set up for a school.</p>

<p>At the same time, several businesses have left, including Kay Jewelers, which moved across the road into the neighboring The Village at Pittsburgh Mills development. Kitchen Collection and a locally owned arcade have closed, and the mall lost Charlotte Russe after the company announced last month it would close all stores and file for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Large parts of the mall remain shuttered and uninhabited with dozens of storefronts empty. Ziencik said she’s happy the nursing school moved in but thinks there is room for more. “I think that the township realizes it’s got to be a mixed-type use — the retail nationwide is just not there to fill this building,” she said. “We’re hopeful the new owners will promote different types of uses that we can look into or consider.” She has previously said a store such as Rural King or an entertainment-driven business such as Dave & Busters would likely be successful. </p>

<img src="index_files/images/closed2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197", style="float: left; padding:0px 15px" />

<p>Shoppers want more. The lack of progress hasn’t gone unnoticed by shoppers who still come to the mall because it’s the only shopping area for many. Madd Sabula travels more than 50 miles to shop at the mall. He lives north of Kittanning and said despite the lack of options at the mall, it’s still his best choice. “We go to Indiana (mall), and the only thing down there is a J.C.Penney,” he said. Sabula said he hopes the food court will be developed to offer more choices. It currently has only three restaurants.</p>

<p>Tarentum resident Sabrina Adams said she comes to the mall about once a week and wishes it had her favorite store, rue21. She has to travel to Monroeville Mall to shop there. The Mills location was one of several the company closed in 2017. “They took that out, and I was pretty upset,” she said. She also misses some of the former food options such as Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and Johnny Rockets.</p>

<p>While customers may see the lack of stores as a failure, that might not necessarily be true, said Manus Clancy, senior managing director of applied data and research with New York City-based Trepp LLC. Trepp provides market research for the real estate and banking industries. While he couldn’t speak specifically to the Pittsburgh Mills mall, Clancy said many malls across the country are transitioning into mixed-use facilities with fewer retailers.</p>

<img src="index_files/images/empty.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197", style="float: right; padding:0px 15px" />

<p>That mold fits Pittsburgh Mills, which has added a church, a gym and several children’s sports facilities in recent years. He said those types of businesses can still draw in families and get foot traffic to the space for the retail that remains. He said for companies like Mason Asset Management that buy struggling properties for relatively cheap prices — about $12 million in the case of Pittsburgh Mills — their costs can remain low because they aren’t saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. “You don’t need Neiman Marcus or Nordstrom to make this work,” he said, referring to two upscale brands. “You just need enough people coming every day so when people walk in there they aren’t spooked.”</p>

<img src="index_files/images/ITT.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197", style="float: left; padding:0px 15px" />

<p>Joe DiRenzo manages his family’s business, Top Hat Formals, which has survived at the mall since 2007.He sees the mall’s problem as a chicken-or-the-egg scenario: shoppers won’t come without stores; stores won’t come without shoppers. “Whoever ends up buying this mall, they’re going to have to have some vision and make hard decisions on what they’re going to do to reuse this property,” he said. “I’m hopeful someone does buy the mall, someone with vision,” he said. “Anyone who buys the mall, they’re going to have to invest a lot of money to repurpose the mall. That’s going to be the best bet. There’s not a lot of growth in the retail sector.”</p>

<p>Ziencik said the township would like to see the mall become a multi-use center, with a mix of recreation, retail, offices and possibly housing. “Somebody would have to have a vision to make it what the trend is across the country,” she said. “We don’t know if that’s even possible until they put it on the market.” </p>

<p>"From the beginning, the stores that made up the mall were not great. They had a lot of tourist stores that just sold Pittsburgh merchandise. Make an indoor ice skating rink, or a Dave and Busters type place. There is no where for kids to go in this area, and teens and adults to shop. There needs to be a major attraction to attract people then build the shops and food court up around that. Such a waste of land right now."</p>

<img src="index_files/images/empty2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197", style="float: right; padding:0px 15px" />

<p>"First rule of real estate...location. location, location. Why anyone thought those communities could support a mall is beyond me. Particularly on this day and age when malls in general are on their way out. The mills had mixed use entertainment when it first opened with lucky strike lanes...but the mgmt was incompetent at best(who closes their kitchen at half time of the super bowl?!), and the demographic of the customers didn't know how to act anyway."</p>

<p>"The place should have never been built to begin with. By the time the right hands were greased to get it in, which took from 1981 until 14 years ago, malls across the country were on their way out. Add to that, this region can't support a mall as proven by the empty mall. It's why it never had the stores that even Monroeville has, much less Ross Park and South Hills Village (Coach, Apple, Nordstrom's, etc). The guy didn't care. He wanted what he wanted. So in the process, anything that was in the surrounding areas left to go the mall and now the mall is dead, too, leaving a path of empty spaces and towns with lost revenue in its wake. Complete nonsense all for the greed of the Zamias brothers. I'm sure they sleep well at night."</p>

<p>"Residents never wanted the mall in the first place but certain Frazer government officials and Zamias did what they wanted. I remember people who voted against referendums to build the Route 28 interchange got sued. It got thrown out but the point was proven that citizens were being bullied to accept this place. Time to consider turning it into an Outlet mall. Lower lease/rent prices and entice businesses to open there. Work with Tanger people to rebrand the mall. They have outlets in Grove City and Washington. To me, the AK Valley is a natural fit for a bargain outlet center. Might be able to salvage it."</p>

<img src="index_files/images/outside.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197", style="float: left; padding:0px 15px" />

<p>"This mall has been a failure since day one. The roadway set-up is terrible; I'm surprised there are not more accidents. I'm not sure why you build a big mall then build strip buildings before the mall itself is housed. The restaurants that are there are nothing new to the area and therefore people aren't going to travel. This is just more poor planning by Democratic officials in Allegheny County."</p>

<p>"Some malls are still doing well such as Ross Park. Online shopping has definitely taken over but can't offer the 'immediate' gratification that brick & mortar stores can. The Mills Mall was dead from the very beginning. Yes the key word is the people that live around Ross Park have money, a strong tax base. The Mills not so much. It is an old area with a lot of older people. No money = no customers = no stores. Just tear it down, it is useless sad to say. It will never be revived as a mall."</p>

<p>"The biggest problem is that there is absolutely nothing there to draw people in. We went to Ross Park a few months ago just for the Lego store. I see my friends from this area posting all the time on fb when they go down the places like Dave and Buster's. People travel out of the area for these things, why can't we have things like this here? Obviously nothing else is working. I live 2 hours out of the area now and I used to stop at the Mills Every time I came down, but last time I didn't even bother, because why bother? There's nothing there."</p>

<p>"Last June Reuters did a story on Mason and their affiliated company Namdar (which owns Beaver Valley Mall and Washington Crown Center). What is happening at Pittsburgh Mills is exactly what they do with their properties - buy them cheap, don't invest any money, offer space for really low rent and milk the cash flow."</p>
